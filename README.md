# Humanitas
A charity which provides transparency to all users. Primarily a coordiation mechanism between different groups of people with aligned incentives but no structure to take advantage.

## Users
Two categories of individuals can join into this ecosystem: 
* **Donors**: _High-income bracket members of society looking to better lives._ Rather than paying taxes to a generic pool of money in the hands of the government and not being able to see how taxes are used or have a direct say in spending, donors can choose to redirect that money to this charity, which tracks the movement of all financial assets on the public Ethereum blockchain for complete transparency of spending. On top of that, with reduced overhead costs, money is used more effectively rather than being lost due to political or economic friction.
* **Recipients**: _Low-income bracket members of society looking for better lives._ Rather than relying on governments to finish planning a budget while debating about the livelihoods of the impoverished like some game, recipients can choose to verify their status as a recipient of low-income benefits to receive not only discounts on necessities not available through federal or state aid but also to receive a small stipend of tokens to receive an additional discount on goods through the goodwill of donors.

Another category of involvement is as a **sponsor**, which provides funding (ETH) particularly for running the contract. Examples of applicable sponsors: Cosmos, Coinbase, and any other company with substantial holdings of ETH interested in making a positive impact by donating funding to operation costs of this charity.

### Donors
Through a Chrome extension, donors give tax-deductible microdonations with every online shopping transaction (either percent-based or fixed, depending on preference). Donors have an incentive to participate not only for rewards but for the low effort-to-reward ratio. All it takes is turning on a Chrome extension and letting the money flow. 

All this money is turned into tokens of a stable coin on the Ethereum blockchain, a token with a fixed exchange rate (i.e. no fluctuation with demand or supply). These tokens represent donations in a way that is transparent and traceable. These tokens can be distributed to recipients to redeem goods within a marketplace. The donor can track their tokens, see directly from the chain what their tokens provide to those in need, and provide on their taxes information to the government demonstrating their tax-deductible contribution to society. Who's gonna say that providing diapers, tampons, toothbrushes, and other necessary goods for basic health is a bad thing?

### Recipients
Anyone who qualifies for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is eligible to be a recipient. (If possible, TANF and WIC status will also be recognized in time.)

Recipients receive discounts for popular products via our discounted products received via bulksale. With a list of users and, more importantly, a list of needs, the charity purchases goods in bulk, making them cheaper for each individual. On top of that, the charity provides each users with tokens to spend on purchases, which the charity will recognize as "coupons" to receive discounts on items. These tokens are tied to the individual's identity and cannot be transferred. If an individual does not redeem these tokens within a certain period of time, they will be rescinded to avoid shortages.

## Business Model
Basic points:
- Donor incentives: Chari
- Recipient incentives, cheaper products and, hopefully, reciprocation in the future after getting back on their feet by paying back into this pool
- Sponsor incentives, tax deductions and positive community image
- 

## Components
* Identity registration, both for donors and for recipients
  + Amazon uses an EBT number and card photo to verify the -- we intend on doing the same
* Bulk orders, to provide discounts on popular necessities (diapers, tampons)
* Holding funds, a central entity which receives funds from these microtransactions
* Partnerships with other crypto companies who will sponsor 
* Multisig wallets for tokens to prevent single points of failures
  + All keys controlled by the charity
* Marketplace, to allow people to access our discounted goods
  + Limits on how much of a certain product can be bought by one individual over a certain period of time to avoid deficits of products
